# AJAAP
AJAAP is a C-like compiler (similar optimizer, and other back end stuff) but compiles Java files into 
real executable objects for your operating environment. No more converting Java code into Java bytecode
or compiling using the JVM. 

(This is a new repository. Nothing is added yet, source code and binaries in zip files will be added
later in time.)
